/*
The data provided in the requests.csv file represents the requests from students to take specific
courses as listed in the catalog. Each record has two fields: simply, (1) the ID of the student; and, (2)
the ID of the course being requested. As discussed in the previous design sessions, there are various
reasons why a specific course request might not be granted. Your system must use the information
provided in the various files to determine if each request is valid or not based on the various
requirements. For example, the first line of the file below represents student 9 (Gary Allen)
requesting to take course 13 (Machine Learning). Here is an example of the requests.csv file:
9,13
16,29
15,29
